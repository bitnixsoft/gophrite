[] What is it...

It's a browser for the Gopher protocol... the "old-web", build 
specifically for smartphone usage, thus making the experience of surfing
Gopher, better.

  If you want to know more about Gopher... just search it on the NEt :p


[] How to Use...

Just any other browser, you are using. GOPHRite, tries to imitate the
browsing experience of the well known Web Browsers. So, you can use the
address bar, to enter a new Gopher site, use the Bookmark system, to
store your favorite ones and navigate through Gopher sites, with just
your finger tips.


[] Features...

 - You can export the loaded page, in HTML and plain text
 - Add/Remove Bookmarks, based on categories
 - Use CSS Theme styling for the loaded pages, which include Icons and
   Fonts
 - Download, Save and Open files, via the OS
 - Easy browsing, by using buttons to ZOOM IN/OUT and scroll page by page! 
   This imitates the normal Console/Terminal, thus you don't have to use 
   your fingers to scroll or zoom. You can browse a site, by just using
   one hand.
 - Open external links, like Telnet, with your favorite Android app.
 - Debug your Gopher site, with Debug mode
 - Search Gopher space, with a click of a button
